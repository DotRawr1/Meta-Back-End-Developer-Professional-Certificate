# Big O Notation
# horrible, bad, fair, good, excellent
# efficency in time and space

# constant time: same time and space regardless of input
# example: dictionary. no iterations to find keys

# linear time: the bigger the range, the longer the running time
# example: for x in range(100) vs for x in range(1000000)

# logarithmic time: running time of input vs running time of operations
# example: breaking searches down to reduce amount to check, vs checking one by one

# quadratic time: linear operation of input data squared
# example: nested loops

# exponential time: algorithm that doubles with each iteration
# example: fibonacci sequence
