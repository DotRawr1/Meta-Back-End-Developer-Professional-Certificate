# least tests with the most defects found

## white box testing
# tester has knowledge of codes functionality
## black box testing
# no idea of internal implimentation

## functional tests
# determine if features and functionalities are in line with expectations
## non functional tests
# overall performance and quality
## maintenance tests
# system is  corrected, changed, or extended

## unit/component testings
# tests components by isolating them
# often automated, and written as code is written
## integration testing
# combines units and tests the flow of data from one to another
## system testing
# tests against set of requirements to check for completeness
## acceptance testing
# already ready for deployment
# expected to be bug free and meets standards

## Unitest - built-in package
# automation, independent testing modules, aggregation
## PyTest - native python library
# functional, parameterized, parallel testing
# can integrate with other test frameworks and web frameworks
## robot - keyword driven development 
# keywords can be predefined or user defined
# acceptance testing, robotic process automation (RPA), test driven development
# can be used on andriod, in APIS, and mainframes
## selenium - web applications
# browser and OS support, browser specific drivers, many options

## test driven development (TDD)
# tests are written, then code is written to pass
## write a test for a feature that fails
## write code in accordance with the tests
## run the tests expecting failure
## evaluation the error and fix code as needed
## repeat 
# tests with specific outcome in mind
# clarity from beginning of project
# makes integrating components easier
# easier to refactor
